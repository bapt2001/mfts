# Biography

Steve Paxton has researched the fiction of cultured dance and the “truth” of improvisation for 35 years.
He has been involved mainly in improvising, building on the experience of his own body, which he
questions constantly, as well as questioning reality and one’s presence to the world. By having dance
rhyme with resistance to all powers other than physical laws, Paxton has given dance a quasi-libertarian
status. Born in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1939. He first trained as a gymnast, studied a variety of modern
forms (Graham, Limon...) and ballet, as well as yoga, and Tai Chi Chuan. His study of Aikido began in
1964 at Hombu Dojo in Tokyo, continuing in New York City under Yamada Sensei. Simultaneously, he
performed with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company (1960-64) – due to a deep affinity with John
Cage’s, Merce Cunningham’s and Robert Rauschenberg’s philosophies, experimentations and extended
vision of art and performance. His appetite for deconstruction, exploration, subversion and invention led
him to become a founding member of the Judson Dance Theater, which came out of Robert Dunn’s
workshops, Dunn himself being inspired by John Cage’s methods. Paxton’s partners in experimentation
were, to name a few, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Robert Rauschenberg, Lucinda Childs... This Judson
movement was most influential in the emerging of “contemporary dance” at different times in many
countries around the world. In tune with his interest for science and technology, he participated in the
“Nine Evenings of Theater and Engineering” in 1966, initiated by Billy Klüver, an engineer at Bell Labs,
in association with Robert Rauschenberg.
He was also a founding member of The Grand Union (1970-1976), an improvisation collective reuniting
several original Judson performers: Yvonne Rainer, David Gordon, Trisha Brown, as well as Douglas
Dunn... In 1972, he instigated Contact Improvisation to deal with the basics of the moving body: weight,
touch, give and take, balance... Contact Improvisation went on to escape all boarders, continuing today as
an international network of dancers who convene to practice and publish news and research in the dance
and improvisation journal, Contact Quarterly. In 1986, he definitely chose the path of improvisation
linked to research on body and movement, founding Touchdown Dance with Anne Kilcoyne in England,
in order to offer an approach of dance to the visually disabled and otherwise handicapped, while also
deeply questioning the status of performance in the Western culture. Also in 1986, he began work on
Material for the Spine. MFS is derived from observation of Contact Improvisation, in which the spine
becomes an essential “limb”. MFS is a meditative, technical study of spinal and pelvic movement
initiations. Paxton lectures, performs, choreographs and teaches primarily in the USA, the rest of
Americas and Europe. He was a long-term guest artist on the faculties of Bennington College, USA
(1970-1975), Dartington College of Arts (1970s and 1980s) in the United-Kingdom, and School for New
Dance Development (1980s), and European Dance Development Center (1990s) in Holland. He has
taught at other institutions and studios around the world.
Festival performances include KaaiTheater (Brussels), which commissioned four works, between1981
and 1992, as well as Festival d’Automne (Paris, 1998), Side Step (Helsinki, 2001 and 2005) and the world
tour of PastForward in 2000-2001 (White Oak/Michael Baryshnikov’s production about the Judson
Church Dance Theater). Two of his early works from the 1960s (Flat and Satisfying Lover) were part of
PastForward, in which Paxton also occasionally participated with an improvised solo – or even replaced
Baryshnikov in Flat. Paxton has received NY "Bessie" awards for on-going choreography in 1987 and
1999, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, Contemporary
Performance Arts Foundation, and Change, Inc. In 1994, he received the Vermont Governor's Award for
Excellence in the Arts and, in 1995, a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2008, he appeared with Lisa Nelson in
Night Stand in Spain and Japan. In the meantime, Contredanse in Brussels published a DVD-rom about
Material for the Spine, and organized an exhibition about it, Phantom Exhibition, while preparing the
publication of Paxton’s book and its translation. Paxton lives on a farm in Vermont.
